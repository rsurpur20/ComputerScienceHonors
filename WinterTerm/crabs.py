# In a game of crabs, we roll two dice and find their sum.Â There are three possible scenarios leading to a win or loss.
# 1. If the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), we win.
# 2. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called crabs), we lose.
# 3. Otherwise, we roll the dice until we get the initial sum (win) or a sum of 7 (lose).
#how many games do you have to play in order to have at least a 50% chance of winning
# percentage of wins over num games
# work on the question
